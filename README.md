# TinyBERT-Ablation
![cover](docs/images/02-readme-cover.png)  

TinyBERT-Ablation is a KAIST CS50700 Deep Learning final project that replicates and
extends TinyBERT's task distillation with granular control over knowledge
distillation (KD) loss components.

- **Logit KD**: match teacher output distributions.
- **Hidden KD**: match selected teacher hidden states through learned projections.
- **Attention KD**: match teacher attention probabilities.

Each run writes structured metadata, evaluation metrics, and loss magnitudes so
the ablation can be analyzed reproducibly.

## 1. Datasets

Datasets are selected with `--dataset <key>` and share the same teacher/student
pipeline.

| Dataset | `--dataset` | Task | Train / Dev / Test | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [TweetEval-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_eval) | `tweet_eval-sentiment` | sentiment | 45,615 / 2,000 / 12,284 | official splits |
| [IMDB](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/imdb) | `imdb` | sentiment | 22,500 / 2,500 / 25,000 | seed-42 dev split |
| [ANLI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/anli) | `anli` | NLI | 162,865 / 3,200 / 3,200 | sentence-pair input |
| [Davidson](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tdavidson/hate_speech_offensive) | `davidson` | hate speech | 19,825 / 2,479 / 2,479 | seed-42 80/10/10 split |
| [DynaHate](https://github.com/bvidgen/Dynamically-Generated-Hate-Speech-Dataset) | `dynahate` | hate speech | 32,924 / 4,100 / 4,120 | local CSV |
| [HatEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/valeriobasile/HatEval) | `hateval` | hate speech | 13,500 / 1,500 / 4,570 | HF-gated |
| [FEVER](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pietrolesci/nli_fever) | `fever` | NLI | 45,000 / 19,998 / 5,000 | 50K train cap |
| [VarDial](https://huggingface.co/datasets/statworx/swiss-dialects) | `vardial` | dialect ID | 3,793 / 475 / 475 | seed-42 80/10/10 split |

Local datasets are gitignored: save DynaHate to
`data/dynahate/dynahate_v0.2.3.csv`. HatEval requires accepting the Hugging Face
terms and logging in before use.

## 3. Getting Started

Run commands from the repository root.

### 3.1. Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n tinybert-xai python=3.12
conda activate tinybert-xai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3.2. Teacher Fine-Tuning

Train the BERT teacher (`--dataset` selects a registered dataset; default
`tweet_eval-sentiment`, also `imdb`, `anli`):

```bash
python scripts/01_train_teacher.py --dataset tweet_eval-sentiment
```

Training automatically evaluates on dev/test when it finishes. Expected
artifacts:

- `results/checkpoints/tweet_eval-sentiment/teacher/best.pt`
- `results/metadata/tweet_eval-sentiment/teacher/run_metadata.json`

### 3.3. Student Distillation

Describe a student run in a YAML config. The scripts read `config.yaml` in the
repo root by default; edit it, or pass `--config <file>` to use a different one.

```bash
python scripts/02_train_student.py                  # uses ./config.yaml
python scripts/02_train_student.py --config my_run.yaml
```

To define a condition, set which teacher signals the student learns from under
`run.conditions` (`logit`/`hidden`/`attention`); all off is the `ce_only`
baseline.

Expected artifacts:

- `results/checkpoints/<dataset>/student/<condition>/best.pt`
- `results/metadata/<dataset>/student/<condition>/run_metadata.json`

### 3.4. Full Factorial Sweep

Run the teacher fine-tune (once) plus all 8 student conditions for one dataset
with a single command. The sweep invokes the per-run scripts as subprocesses for
clean per-run GPU memory isolation and is resumable. Artifacts that already
exist are skipped unless `--force`:

```bash
python scripts/07_run_dataset.py --dataset imdb
```

### 3.5. Analysis

Run the factorial analysis for a dataset (defaults to the pilot):

```bash
python scripts/06_analyze_factorial.py tweet_eval-sentiment
```

Artifacts are written per dataset under `results/analysis/<dataset>/`, so running
the analysis for another dataset never overwrites an existing report:

- `results/analysis/<dataset>/REPORT.md`
- `results/analysis/<dataset>/figures`

### 3.6. Cross-Dataset Analysis

Once several datasets have completed sweeps, roll them up into the cross-task
presentation assets. This runs in two stages, written under
`results/analysis/cross_dataset/`.

**Stage 1, metadata only (no GPU).** Reads every
`results/metadata/<dataset>/student/<condition>/run_metadata.json` that is present:

```bash
python scripts/08_cross_dataset_analysis.py
```

- `figures/cross_task_macro_f1.png`, `figures/cross_task_delta.png`: condition heatmaps
- `figures/confusion`: per-condition confusion matrices.
- `tables/*.csv`: per-dataset factorial-effect tables.
- `TABLES.md`: a quick-read index of the matrices.

**Stage 2, representation + XAI artifacts (GPU, reloads checkpoints).** Runs
forward passes on a fixed test sample for every dataset that has both a teacher
and student checkpoint:

```bash
python scripts/08b_representation_analysis.py   # N=256 test sample
```

- `representation/layer_cka.csv`: linear CKA per mapped pair
- `representation/attention_kl.csv`: KL(teacher ‖ student) of attention maps
- `representation/attention/*.png`: teacher-vs-student attention heatmaps

The written interpretation (RQ1/RQ2 answers) lives in
`results/analysis/cross_dataset/CROSS_DATASET.md`.

## 5. Experimental Conditions

| Condition | Logit KD | Hidden KD | Attention KD |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `ce_only` |  |  |  |
| `kd_logit` | Y |  |  |
| `kd_hidden` |  | Y |  |
| `kd_attn` |  |  | Y |
| `kd_logit_hidden` | Y | Y |  |
| `kd_logit_attn` | Y |  | Y |
| `kd_hidden_attn` |  | Y | Y |
| `kd_full` | Y | Y | Y |

## 6. Recommended Loss Weights

Weights default to `1.0`, but the KD losses sit on very different scales
(attention ≈ `0.003` vs CE/logit/hidden ≈ `0.2–0.5`), so attention barely affects
training. To balance them, per-dataset starting points are:

| Dataset | `ce` | `logit` | `hidden` | `attn` |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `tweet_eval-sentiment` | 1.0 | 3.0 | 2.2 | 125 |
| `imdb` | 1.0 | 1.8 | 0.9 | 240 |
| `anli` | 1.0 | 1.3 | 2.1 | 400 |
| `davidson` | 1.0 | 4.0 | 0.9 | 53 |
| `dynahate` | 1.0 | 2.3 | 1.5 | 110 |
| `hateval` | 1.0 | 2.4 | 1.1 | 100 |
| `fever` | 1.0 | 1.8 | 1.5 | 500 |
| `vardial` | 1.0 | 1.6 | 2.3 | 140 |


## 7. Notes / Limitations

- The current pilot is single-seed. The observed `0.0198` student spread should
  not be treated as a statistically resolved per-signal effect.
- Post-softmax Attention KD appears near-inert in the pilot: the final attention
  loss magnitude averages about `0.00453`, much smaller than CE, logit, and
  hidden losses. This should be fixed or explicitly documented before larger
  multi-dataset runs.

Transformers/Datasets for the modern implementation. It was developed as a final
project for KAIST CS50700 Deep Learning.
